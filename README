Port of ISAAC CSPRNG - http://burtleburtle.net/bob/rand/isaac.html
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISAAC_(cipher)

This is an implementation of the cryptographically secure pseudorandom
number generator which is suitable for getting random data for programs
needing high quality and secure random data - for GnuPG, Diffie-Hellman
and others.

ATTENTION: Output of any single integer is limited to 32 bits.

Stretches a seed or key consisting of 256 32b ints (not quite indefinitely).

Usage:
        import Isaac
        x = Isaac.Isaac(seed_vector or None)
        x.rand(42) -> 0 <= y <= 41
