Port of ISAAC CSPRNG - http://github.com/bai/crypt-isaac/
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISAAC_(cipher)
 

This is an implementation of the cryptographically secure pseudorandom 
number generator which is suitable for getting random data for programs 
needing high quality and secure random data - for GnuPG, Diffie-Hellman 
and others.

Seeding from /dev/urandom or /dev/random. If these do not exist
Python's builtin random.randint() will be used.
In this case the potential security level is reduced.

ATTENTION: Output of any single integer is limited to 32 bits.
Usage:
        import Isaac()
        x = Isaac.Isaac()
        x.rand(42) -> 0 <= y <= 41
